Child Development Academy students have the opportunity to conduct formal classroom observations, develop and deliver lesson plans, and participate in special events and activities with either an on-site or nearby child care or preschool facility. The Child Development Academy offers students the knowledge and skills needed to work in child care immediately after high school while preparing them to attend college for a degree in child development, education, psychology, social work or other related major. Students can earn a child care certificate, college credits, and even complete an internship during their senior year by working with children in a school, agency or business setting.
