The Visual Communications Academy, which contains two pathways-Graphic Design and Animation-is designed for students with an interest in the elements of design and techniques related to the field of visual communications. Students in both pathways have the opportunity to combine creative abilities with technical skills and knowledge and develop skills in problem solving, team building, collaboration, portfolio development and artistic promotions. The Graphic Design pathway emphasizes publication design, web design and other digital design, such as illustration, digital imaging and videography. The Animation pathway emphasizes architectural, mechanical, and forensic modeling techniques and demonstrates how these techniques can be applied to the entertainment and videography industries.
