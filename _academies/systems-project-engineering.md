Students in this academy focus on technical concepts including mechanical drawings, fabrication, electronics, mechanics, data acquisition and analysis.They follow the engineering design process and work in teams to design, build, and test a single passenger electronically-powered vehicle. Students use computer-based design and modeling software, as well as basic welding and machining, to construct the vehicle. Students will be prepared for continued study in a variety of engineering careers.
