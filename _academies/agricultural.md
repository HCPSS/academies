The Agriculture and Natural Resources Academy offers exciting “hands-on” activities, projects, and problems. Student experiences will involve the science of agriculture, plants, animals, biotechnology natural resources, and agricultural mechanics. While surveying the opportunities available in agriculture and natural resources, students will learn to solve problems, conduct research, analyze data, work in teams, and take responsibility for their work, actions, and learning. Additionally students will learn the principles of plant science through topics such as the mechanisms and interactions of plant systems, soil and soilless systems to propagate and produce plant materials, classifying plants using scientific naming, anatomy and physiology of plants, growing environments and pests and diseases.
