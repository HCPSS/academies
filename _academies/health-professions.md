The Academy of Health Professions offers students the opportunity to learn about the world of medicine, engage in clinical experiences, and interact with professionals in the medical community. Students will explore various career opportunities through hands-on training in basic medical skills, medical equipment use, and patient contact and communication. Areas of study include professional behaviors of health care workers, ethical and legal considerations of health care providers, human body structure and function, human development and basic needs. Students will learn about specialized health fields to help them choose from three specific pathways - Clinical Research in Allied Health, Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) - each with its own clinical skills training, internship experiences, and certifications.
