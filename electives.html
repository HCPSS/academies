<h2 id="bus-comp">Business and Computer Management</h2>

<p>The HCPSS Business and Computer Management Systems program is part of the Career and Technology cluster. The program consists of courses in the areas of computer applications, business and finance, accounting, marketing, computer programming, computer repair and networking. These courses provide students the opportunity to develop abilities necessary to perform in today's technology based work environments, to seek advanced training, and to fulfill personal goals. Study in these areas can enhance students problem solving and higher order thinking skills.</p>

<p>Courses within the BCMS program are available at all HCPSS high schools and at Homewood. All courses are taught in a computer lab setting. Instructors utilize a variety of instructional strategies to ensure that all students are working towards content mastery. Advanced level courses have a strong emphasis on project-based learning.</p>

<h3>High School Family and Consumer Sciences</h3>

<p>High School students can</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explore options and prepare for professional careers in Child Development, Teaching, the Culinary Sciences, and Hotel and Restaurant Management.</li>
  <li>Explore an interest in Fashion and Interior Design and satisfy the Fine Arts graduation requirement by enrolling in Foundations of Fashion and Interior Design, 6556.</li>

<p>Family and Consumer Sciences is an interdisciplinary study providing students hands-on activities to develop the technical, critical thinking, problem solving, decision-making and interpersonal skills that will empower them to manage the challenges of living and working in a diverse society. </p>

<p>Four high school Career Academy Programs are offered under Family and Consumer Sciences: Child Development, Culinary Sciences, Hotel and Restaurant Management, and the Teacher Academy of Maryland (TAM).  Students in these academies have the opportunity to explore career options in these fields, prepare for college and receive college credit for coursework completed in high school, gain hands-on experience through internships and mentorships, and participate in special activities and events including field trips, competitions, and conferences.</p>

<h2 id="tech-ed">Technology Education</h2>

<p>The Howard County Technology Education middle and high school programs prepare students for our scientific and technological world. We offer educational programs that focus on human endeavors to apply technology in the solution of societal problems that are part of core content, creating a technologically literate person and the education of all students.</p>

<p>The work to develop content standards for Technology Education began in 1995 with the national Technology for All Americans Project (TFAAP). The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) funded this project to develop a nationally viable rationale and structure for technology education. The International Technology Education Association (ITEA) led this effort, and in 1996 TfAAP published Technology for <em>All Americans: A Rationale and Structure for the Study of Technology</em>. This document provided the foundation for state Technology Education content standards and established the guidelines for what each person should know and be able to do in order to be technologically literate. ITEA continued to build upon this work to present a general-content framework for Technology Education, and in 2000, <em>Standards for Technological Literacy: Content for the Study of Technology</em> was published and disseminated.</p>

<h3>Technology: An Educational Discipline</h3>

<p>As the primary instructional program delivering technological literacy in Howard County, the Technology Education program has defined, in measurable terms, what it means for Howard County youth to be "technologically literate," which is the ability to use, manage, understand, and assess technology.</p>

<p>As evidenced in the final report of the Maryland State Visionary Panel, teachers must have access to a precise and challenging curriculum, one that is uniform in content and expectations and fully aligned with state standards. Additionally, teachers must have the technical assistance and support they need to translate curriculum into effective, individualized instruction.</p>

<h3>Middle School</h3>

<p>Exploring Technology, Invention and Innovation, and Applications of Technology are grade level titles corresponding to course guides developed by the Center to Advance the Teaching of Technology and Science (CATTS); the professional develop arm of the International Technology Education Association. The CATTS material help guide instruction at the various grade levels.</p>

<p>Throughout the middle school technology education experience, students will be guided on the path to "technological literacy" at deeper levels in each grade level. Verbs used to describe outcomes move in a hierarchy from a level of discussion and exploration in the sixth grade, to the student being able to describe and recognize in the seventh grade, and explain and apply in the eighth grade. The nature of each course incorporates many activities into a "hands-on" format that help students to meet and exceed each objective.</p>

<h3>High School</h3>

<p>Technology education is taught in an active laboratory setting, rich with hands-on, multi-sensory experiences.  The goal of the program is to develop technologically literate citizens who demonstrate the ability to use, manage, understand, and assess technology.  Student assessment in technology education recognizes various ways in which students demonstrate achievement.</p>

<p>This program includes courses that meet the required technology education graduation credit standard as defined by the Maryland State Department of Education.</p>
